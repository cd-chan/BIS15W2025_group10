This folder contains the original analysis scripts that went into Shiny_App.Rmd. 

rating_year_line.Rmd: Line graph showing the relationship between a year and the average rating of all the TV shows that started in that year. Found on the "Ratings vs. Year" tab of the Shiny App.
ratings_director_bar.Rmd: Bar graph showing the average ratings of top directors' TV shows. Found on the "Comparisons" tab of the Shiny App.
tab3_bar.Rmd: Shiny App with just the "Top Shows by Genre" tab.
tab4_density_box.Rmd: Shiny App with just the "Distribution of Ratings" tab.
top_media_genre.Rmd: graph-only form of the "Top Shows by Genre" tab.

not_used: Contains ratings_runtime_scatter.Rmd, a script that creates a scatter plot of ratings and run time. This analysis was not used in the final product because some run times were of individual episodes while others were the total of all episodes in a show.
