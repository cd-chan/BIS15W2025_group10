## **Project Overview**  
This project explores **factors influencing the popularity and success of TV shows** over time. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, we identify key attributes such as genre, directors, stars, and audience engagement (number of votes) that impact TV show rankings.  

Our process involves:  
1. **Data Cleaning** – Formatting dates, separating movies from TV shows, separating directors and stars, and ensuring a tidy dataset.  
2. **Data Analysis** – Examining patterns in ratings, longevity, and audience reception.  
3. **Shiny App Development** – Creating an interactive web application to visualize and explore key insights dynamically.  

## **Data Description**  
- The original dataset is `movies.csv` in /data.
- The original TV dataset is `tv.csv` in /data.

## **Installation & Requirements**  
To run this project, you need:  
- **R** 
- **RStudio** (recommended for execution)  
- Required packages: included in individual files.

## **Usage**  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Run `clean.Rmd` to preprocess and clean the dataset. New CSV files have already been written into the /data directory.

2. **Perform Analysis and Launch the Shiny App**  
   - Open `Shiny_App.Rmd` in RStudio and click Run to interact with the data.  

## **Key Findings**  
Our analysis reveals that several factors are associated a TV show’s popularity in rankings. Specifically:

- Genre: Certain genres like history/news consistently rank higher than others.
- Number of Votes: Shows with very few and very high audience votes often correlate with higher popularity.
- Directors: Directors like Michael Dante DiMartino and S.J. Clarkson are associated with successful TV shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender and Dexter.
- Stars: Stars like Deneen Fendig and Lisa Kreuzer also star in popular TV shows like The Midnight Gospel and Dark.
