## **Project Overview**  
This project explores **factors influencing the popularity and success of TV shows** over time. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, we identify key attributes such as genre, directors, stars, and audience engagement (number of votes) that impact TV show rankings.  

Our process involves:  
1. **Data Cleaning** – Formatting dates, separating movies from TV shows, separating directors and stars, and ensuring a tidy dataset.  
2. **Data Analysis** – Examining patterns in ratings, longevity, and audience reception.  
3. **Shiny App Development** – Creating an interactive web application to visualize and explore key insights dynamically.  

## **Data Description**  
- The dataset includes TV shows, ratings, genres, directors, cast members, and audience votes.  

## **Installation & Requirements**  
To run this project, you need:  
- **R** 
- **RStudio** (recommended for execution)  
- Required packages: included in individual files.

## **Usage**  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Run `data_cleaning.Rmd` to preprocess and clean the dataset. New CSV files have already been written into the /data directory.

2. **Perform Analysis**  
   - Run `analysis.R` to generate visualizations and insights.  

3. **Launch the Shiny App**  
   - Open `Shiny_App.Rmd` in RStudio and click Run to interact with the data.  

## **Key Findings**  
- **Genre** influences a TV show’s popularity.  
- **Well-known directors & showrunners** tend to produce high-ranking shows.  
- **Star power** plays a crucial role in attracting audiences.
