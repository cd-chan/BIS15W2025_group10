## R Markdown

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
=======
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
setwd("/Users/danielyang/Desktop/BIS15W2025_group10")
all <- read_csv("movies.csv")
tv <- read_csv("tvs.csv")
names(all)
names(tv)
```

```{r}
all <- rename(all, name = MOVIES) # rename "MOVIES" column to "name" to match tv data set
names(all)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Strips whitespace and changes movie names to lowercase.
all <- all %>%
  mutate(name = name |>
           str_trim() |>
           str_to_lower()
         )
head(all)
```
